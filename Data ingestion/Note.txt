*in the original usage all the dataset files are placed in the same folder as KafkaProducer. It is a requirement but this too can be changed by a coder.

*The timestamps in each row(added at producer side) is used by data recon for accurate results. the current version requires this though it can be configgured to work without timestamps

* time in data recon can be set to any value from present to past in the format specified. It will give data reconciliation of that exact time.
  
* The speed of the consumer can be increased by way of creatings files for 5-10 secs for each table while collecting data from topic and send it after that.
      * I would suggest usage of Max heap data structure for that where the one file that has spent max time in consumer is sent first to azure
